## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project implements a **Smart Route Planner** using **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.  
The program demonstrates how to build and traverse graphs efficiently using adjacency lists and priority queues.  

It reads a graph from standard input, computes the optimal route, and prints:
- Total number of nodes and edges  
- Source and target nodes  
- Fastest route (path sequence)  
- Total minimum cost
